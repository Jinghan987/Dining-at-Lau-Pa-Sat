# Lau-Pa-Sat--machine-learning
Using BeautifulSoup, first I will conduct webscraping on TripAdvisor to obtain the reviews on Lau Pa Sat. Using the reviews, I will answer questions like whether it is worth going down to Lau Pa Sat. After that, I will utilise algorithms like TextBlob and Naive Bayes which uses the principles of supervised learning for classification in my pursuit to obtain an effective sentiment classifier.
