# Lau-Pa-Sat--machine-learning
Using BeautifulSoup, first I will conduct webscraping on TripAdvisor to obtain the reviews on Lau Pa Sat. Using the reviews, I will answer questions like whether it is worth doing down to Lau Pa Sat. Also, I will utilise algorithms like TextBlob and Naive Bayes in my pursuit to obtain the best sentiment classifier.
